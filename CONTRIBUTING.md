# Contribute

## Basics

For now, I'm prioritizing speed - meaning I'm not going to be too picky about contributions as long as they work and
match the general direction of the project. See the [roadmap](./README.md#roadmap) for more info.

1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Open a PR
4. I'll review it and (very likely) merge it

## Suggestions, but not requirements

- Use [stylua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) for formatting. This can be simplified by installing
    [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and running `pre-commit install` in the root of the project.
- Prefix commit messages with ✅ for new features, 🐛 for bug fixes, and 👌 for anything else.
